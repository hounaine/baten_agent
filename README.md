# FLVH-BA/CIP Agent System

Welcome to the **FLVH-BA/CIP Agent System**, a modular and extensible framework for building domain-specific AI agents. This repository showcases how you can leverage a structured approach (FLVH-BA/CIP) to create customized agents that integrate seamlessly with your corporate data and workflows, while preserving confidentiality.

## Overview

The **FLVH-BA/CIP** methodology stands for:
- **F**: First
- **L**: Last
- **V**: Visible
- **H**: Hidden  
combined with  
- **BA**: Before/After  
- **CIP**: Contextual Importance / Priority

This framework provides a powerful mechanism to **abstract** text into patterns, ensuring an agent can learn and reason effectively without exposing sensitive data. It also supports various domain integrations (WordNet, FrameNet, etc.) and custom corpora.

## Key Features

- **Confidentiality by Design**: FLVH-BA/CIP extracts only *abstract patterns*, maintaining local and private data in your corporate environment.
- **Modular Architecture**: Each agent is isolated in a dedicated folder, with separate corpora for domain-specific needs.
- **Seamless Integrations**: Optional plugins for resources like WordNet, FrameNet, or other semantic tools.
- **Rich Configuration**: Weighted corpora, style guides, and pattern registries let you tailor the system to your enterprise context.
- **Extensibility**: Add more agents, new corpora, or specialized patterns without altering the core engine.
