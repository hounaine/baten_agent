# Baten Agent – Comprehensive Repository Overview

This repository demonstrates the **overall structure** and usage of the Baten Agent framework, designed to integrate domain-specific AI agents with a private advanced engine. All core logic (FLVH-BA/CIP) remains proprietary, but the surrounding files, scripts, and corpora are shown to illustrate how everything fits together.

## Introduction

**Baten Agent** provides a system for creating specialized AI agents that process textual data. While our powerful FLVH-BA/CIP engine is **private** and not exposed here, you can see the **layout** of all other components:

- Example agents in `agents/`
- Text corpora in `corpora/`
- Prototypes for demonstration in `prototypes/`
- Basic integration scripts in `engine/integrations/`

This project was structured to ensure clarity, modularity, and easy extension across multiple agent needs.

## Key Points

1. **Proprietary Engine**: The advanced pattern extraction logic is not included publicly.
2. **Agents**: Each agent resides in its own folder, with domain-specific scripts and corpus data.
3. **Corpora**: Separated into base corpora and company-specific resources.
4. **Prototypes**: Illustrative scripts that highlight possible uses and experiments.
5. **Testing**: Centralized in `tests/` for easy maintenance.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repository** (private/local only):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hounaine/baten_agent.git
   cd baten_agent

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Core Engine (Proprietary)
The heart of the system (FLVH-BA/CIP) is located in engine/flvh/, but it remains private. In this public repository, we only reference placeholder code or minimal stubs. The real logic is not disclosed. Attempting to execute certain scripts will result in partial or stubbed functionality.

Agents
In agents/, you will find separate folders for each specialized agent:

AA01_Flaubert/: Example of a literary-focused agent.

AI01_internal_analysis/: Illustrates internal analytics tasks, using textual data from company_001.txt, etc.

These scripts show how an agent might interface with the hidden engine, update its context, generate text, or evaluate outputs.

Corpora
corpus-base/: General or test data (e.g., flaubert_1.txt).

corpus-company/: Company-specific or specialized data (e.g., style guides, config files).

resources_texts/: Additional textual materials that might be used for demonstration or references.

Place your custom .txt files under these directories to feed the agent. The private engine then processes them if you have the full version internally.

Interface
A minimal script, chat_interface.py, can be found in interface/. It shows how the system might offer a console-based interaction with an agent. Without the proprietary engine, responses are limited or purely illustrative.

Prototypes
Folder for experimental or demonstration scripts:

generate_corpus_dataset.py: Possibly merges or filters text data into a training set.

guided_generation_prototype.py: Demonstrates how generation might run with partial environment context.

hybrid_generation_prototype.py: Combines multiple approaches (embedding selection + rewriting).

They serve as examples or internal tests to guide further development.

Models
chat_agent_model/ and checkpoint-3/ store local or fine-tuned model weights (e.g., T5, Bloom, etc.). Real usage is possible only with the private engine integrated.

Tests
tests/ centralizes scripts to verify partial functionalities. In a real environment, you might run:

bash
Copier
Modifier
pytest tests/
Some tests may fail if the private engine methods are absent.

Usage Guidelines
Add or modify corpora in corpus-company/ or agents/AI01_internal_analysis/corpus/.

Run generate_text_AI01.py or evaluate_agent_AI01.py as examples of agent logic.

Integrate the stubs with the real private engine for full functionality.

Note: This repository alone won’t yield the advanced pattern extraction results because the crucial FLVH-BA/CIP code is omitted.

Future Plans
Stronger Collaboration: Potential GUI for agent interactions.

Extended Documentation: If a collaborator joins under NDA, we can share more details about the FLVH-BA/CIP architecture.

Advanced Integrations: Additional scripts or corpora to demonstrate domain expansions.

Disclaimer
This repository is primarily for structural demonstration. The actual engine logic is kept private to safeguard proprietary technology.

### Explanation

1. **Full detail** on how the project is laid out (agents, corpora, prototypes, etc.).
2. **Explicit disclaimers** that the proprietary engine is absent or minimal, thus limiting real functionality.
3. **Professional tone** to show that you have a robust structure, but are selectively withholding the FLVH code. 
4. **Clear usage instructions** (clone, install, mention partial/stub usage).

You can adapt the text if you need to highlight or hide more details, but this strikes a good balance, being comprehensive while not leaking any confidential FLVH-BA/CIP internals.
