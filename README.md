# BATEN Agent System

Welcome to **BATEN Agent**, a modular and extensible framework for building domain-specific AI agents. This repository illustrates the overall project architecture and how multiple agents can be configured and integrated. Please note that some core logic—particularly the proprietary engine internals—remains private.

## Overview

**BATEN Agent** focuses on:
- Configurable **agents** (e.g., corporate analysis, literary style).
- Separation of **core logic** (private engine) from **agent-specific** scripts and data.
- Clear organization of **corpus** materials.

This repository aims to showcase how you can structure an AI agent system, with minimal or no disclosure of proprietary internal logic.
